        The desktop operating system was designed in 1984 for a single human sitting in front of
        a single screen, opening one application at a time. Forty years later, we are still
        trapped inside that box.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now we are told that artificial intelligence will transform how we work. But look at
        what we have actually built: chatbots bolted onto browsers. Copilots imprisoned in
        sidebars. Agents that can see one application at a time, through a keyhole, while the
        human does the real work of stitching context together.
      </p>

        This is not transformation. This is theatre.

        The fundamental unit of modern work is not the application. It is the
        <strong class="text-text">human-AI team</strong>. A team shares context. A team
        composes capabilities on the fly. A team does not ask permission from an app store or a
        platform vendor.
      </p>

      <p>
        InferNode dissolves these boundaries. The human and the AI agent inhabit the same
        namespace. They see the same resources. They act on the same data. There is no sidebar.
        There is no plugin. There is only the shared space of work itself.
