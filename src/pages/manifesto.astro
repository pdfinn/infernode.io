        <h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-text">The Trust Problem</h2>

        <p>
          AI agents are the most powerful tools we have ever built. An agent that can read
          files, call APIs, spawn sub-processes, and compose capabilities on the fly is
          extraordinarily useful. It is also extraordinarily dangerous.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, every major agent framework runs its agents inside your operating system,
          with your credentials, your network access, and your data. The industry's answer
          is guardrails: sandboxes bolted on top, permission dialogs, policy layers you
          <em>hope</em> hold.
        </p>

        <p class="text-text text-xl font-medium">
          Hope is not an engineering strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
          A prompt injection attack, a confused deputy, a privilege escalation&mdash;and
          the cage opens. The agent reads your SSH keys, exfiltrates your data, or acts with
          authority you never intended to grant. This is not a theoretical risk. It is the
          defining security challenge of the agentic era.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-text">The Inversion</h2>

        <p>
          InferNode does not add guardrails to an insecure foundation. It inverts the model
          entirely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each agent runs in its own <strong class="text-text">namespace</strong>&mdash;a
          view of the world constructed from only the resources you explicitly mount. The
          agent does not start with access to everything and get restricted. It starts with
          access to <strong class="text-text">nothing</strong> and receives only what you grant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Try to access something you weren't given? It doesn't error. It simply does not
          exist. There is no attack surface because there is no surface. A prompt injection
          cannot read your SSH keys because in the agent's namespace, SSH keys do not exist.
          There is nothing to exploit.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not a claim. The isolation model has been <strong class="text-text">formally
          verified</strong> using TLA+, SPIN, and CBMC. Mathematical proof, not just testing.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-text">Safety Creates Freedom</h2>

        <p>
          Here is the insight that changes everything: <strong class="text-text">a provably
          contained agent is an agent you can trust with real autonomy</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you cannot prove containment, you restrict. You add approval workflows,
          human-in-the-loop checkpoints, capability limits. The agent becomes a chatbot with
          extra steps. The productivity gains never arrive.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you <em>can</em> prove containment, you liberate. Give the agent more tools,
          more data, more autonomy&mdash;without more risk. Let it compose capabilities,
          spawn sub-agents, operate across devices. The human-AI team can finally do what it
          was always supposed to: work together at the speed of thought.
        </p>

        <p class="text-text text-xl font-medium">
          Security is not a constraint on productivity. It is the foundation that makes
          productivity possible.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-text">Inferno&reg;: The Architecture of Trust</h2>

        <p>
          Inferno&reg; was born from Bell Labs&mdash;the same lineage that gave us Unix, C, and the
          foundations of modern computing. But where the industry chose the desktop metaphor,
          Inferno&reg; chose a different path: everything is a file, every file is accessible
          across the network, and every process runs in its own namespace.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was not designed for AI agents. It was designed for distributed systems that
          demand trust. Telecommunications networks serving billions. Industrial control
          systems. Environments where failure is not an option. The fact that it is precisely
          what AI agents need is not a coincidence&mdash;it is convergence.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 9P protocol&mdash;Inferno&reg;'s native language&mdash;lets resources flow across
          networks with radical simplicity. No REST APIs. No OAuth handshakes. No middleware. No
          cloud dependency. Just files, namespaces, and the freedom to compose them as the mission
          demands.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-text">Veltro: The Unchained Agent</h2>

        <p>
          Veltro is an AI agent that does not live inside an application. It lives inside a
          namespace&mdash;your namespace&mdash;alongside your data, your tools, your sensors, and
          your decisions. It does not ask for API access. It does not require a platform
          subscription. It composes capabilities from whatever resources are present, wherever they
          are: on your device, on the edge, across your network.
        </p>

        <p>
          Veltro can do more because it is provably contained. It can act autonomously because
          you can prove the boundaries hold. It does not puppet you through a workflow designed
          by a product manager in California. It works with you, at the speed of thought, toward
          the outcome that matters.
        </p>

        <p class="text-text">
          This is what human-AI teaming actually looks like when trust is the foundation,
          not an afterthought.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-text">The Future Is Not Apps</h2>

        <p>
          The application era is ending. Not because applications are bad, but because they encode
          the wrong abstraction. An app assumes a single user, a single device, a predetermined
          workflow. The world we are building assumes none of these things.
        </p>

        <p>
          The future belongs to capabilities and skills&mdash;composable, distributed,
          trustworthy. Data sources that are accessible without gatekeepers. AI agents that are
          peers, not plugins. Edge computing that is affordable and sovereign, not rented from a
          hyperscaler on someone else's terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inferno&reg; makes this possible. Not as a prototype. Not as a research curiosity. As a
          production system with a thirty-year pedigree, proven at the scale of telecommunications
          networks that serve billions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-text">A Declaration</h2>

        <div class="space-y-4 border-l-2 border-accent/40 pl-6 text-text">
          <p>We declare that AI agents deserve provable containment, not bolted-on guardrails.</p>
          <p>We declare that security and productivity are not opposites&mdash;security is the
            foundation that enables productivity.</p>
          <p>
            We declare that the human and the AI deserve to work in a shared space, with shared
            context, toward shared outcomes&mdash;and that this is only possible when trust is
            proven, not assumed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We declare that computing should be distributed, composable, and sovereign by default.
          </p>
          <p>We declare that it is time to build on a foundation worthy of trust.</p>
