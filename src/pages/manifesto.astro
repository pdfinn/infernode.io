        We Were Never Meant<br />to Work Like This
      </h1>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-text-muted">

        <p>
          The desktop operating system was designed in 1984 for a single human sitting in front
          of a single screen, opening one application at a time. Forty years later, we are still
          trapped inside that box.
        </p>

        <p>
          We tile windows. We alt-tab between silos. We copy and paste across boundaries that
          should not exist. Every application is a walled garden. Every workflow is a forced march
          through someone else's interface. The desktop was built for isolation, and isolation is
          exactly what it delivers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we are told that artificial intelligence will transform how we work. But look at
          what we have actually built: chatbots bolted onto browsers. Copilots imprisoned in
          sidebars. Agents that can see one application at a time, through a keyhole, while the
          human does the real work of stitching context together.
        </p>

        <p class="text-text text-xl font-medium">
          This is not transformation. This is theatre.
        </p>

        <p>
          The productivity gains have not arrived&mdash;not because AI is inadequate, but because
          we are forcing it to perform inside an architecture that was never designed for
          collaboration. The desktop paradigm does not merely constrain AI. It constrains us.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-text">The Box Must Break</h2>

        <p>
          The fundamental unit of modern work is not the application. It is the
          <strong class="text-text">human-AI team</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A team does not operate through menus and modal dialogs. A team shares context. A team
          composes capabilities on the fly. A team moves fluidly between data sources, tools, and
          decisions without asking permission from an app store or a platform vendor.
        </p>

        <p>
          The desktop cannot give us this. It was not built for it. No amount of plugins,
          extensions, or API wrappers will change what it is: a forty-year-old metaphor optimised
          for filing cabinets and typewriters, dressed up in flat design.
        </p>

        <p>
          We do not need another integration layer. We need liberation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-text">Inferno: Computing Without Walls</h2>

        <p>
          Inferno was born from Bell Labs&mdash;the same lineage that gave us Unix, C, and the
          foundations of modern computing. But where the industry chose the desktop, Inferno chose
          a different path: everything is a file, and every file is accessible across the network.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Inferno, there are no applications. There are capabilities&mdash;resources presented
          as files in a namespace that any process, on any device, can compose and use. A sensor
          feed, a language model, a database, a drone controller: all appear as files. All are
          composable. All are distributed by design.
        </p>

        <p class="text-text">
          This is not a new idea. It is an idea whose time has finally come.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 9P protocol&mdash;Inferno's native language&mdash;lets resources flow across
          networks with radical simplicity. No REST APIs. No OAuth handshakes. No middleware. No
          cloud dependency. Just files, namespaces, and the freedom to compose them as the mission
          demands.
        </p>

        <p>
          Where the desktop forces you into sequential, modal interaction&mdash;one app, one task,
          one context&mdash;Inferno dissolves those boundaries entirely. The human and the AI agent
          inhabit the same namespace. They see the same resources. They act on the same data. There
          is no sidebar. There is no plugin. There is only the shared space of work itself.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-text">Veltro: The Unchained Agent</h2>

        <p>
          This is why we built Veltro.
        </p>

        <p>
          Veltro is an AI agent that does not live inside an application. It lives inside a
          namespace&mdash;your namespace&mdash;alongside your data, your tools, your sensors, and
          your decisions. It does not ask for API access. It does not require a platform
          subscription. It composes capabilities from whatever resources are present, wherever they
          are: on your device, on the edge, across your network.
        </p>

        <p>
          Veltro does not puppet you through a workflow designed by a product manager in
          California. It works with you, at the speed of thought, toward the outcome that matters.
        </p>

        <p class="text-text">
          This is what human-AI teaming actually looks like when you remove the box.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-text">The Future Is Not Apps</h2>

        <p>
          The application era is ending. Not because applications are bad, but because they encode
          the wrong abstraction. An app assumes a single user, a single device, a predetermined
          workflow. The world we are building assumes none of these things.
        </p>

        <p>
          The future belongs to capabilities and skills&mdash;composable, distributed,
          trustworthy. Data sources that are accessible without gatekeepers. AI agents that are
          peers, not plugins. Edge computing that is affordable and sovereign, not rented from a
          hyperscaler on someone else's terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inferno makes this possible. Not as a prototype. Not as a research curiosity. As a
          production system with a thirty-year pedigree, proven at the scale of telecommunications
          networks that serve billions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-text">A Declaration</h2>

        <div class="space-y-4 border-l-2 border-accent/40 pl-6 text-text">
          <p>We declare that the desktop paradigm has failed the human-AI team.</p>
          <p>We declare that modal, application-centric computing is a constraint, not a feature.</p>
          <p>
            We declare that true productivity gains require architectural freedom&mdash;not better
            integrations, not smarter wrappers, not another layer of abstraction on top of a broken
            foundation.
          </p>
          <p>
            We declare that the human and the AI deserve to work in a shared space, with shared
            context, toward shared outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We declare that computing should be distributed, composable, and sovereign by default.
          </p>
          <p>We declare that it is time to leave the box.</p>
